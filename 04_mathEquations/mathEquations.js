//Replace the strings to the right of the = with the expression they describe. Do not manually enter the answers to the equation.

// Currently, the variables are strings. They need to be math equations instead.

// To help you, the first variable has been completed for you:

// const a = 1 - 1 // Freebie!!! This is the answer to "one minus one"
// The following is an example of the wrong answer:

// const a = 0 // WRONG!!! You need to write out the equation, NOT put the result of the equation directly!
// Feel free to run the test suite right now to see the first test pass, then go from there. Good luck!


const a = 1 - 1 // Freebie!!! This is the answer to "one minus one"
const b = 1 + 8
const c = 22 * 3
const d = 5 % 3
const e = 'b - 17'
const f = 'a + b + c + d +e'

// Do not edit below this line
module.exports = {a, b, c, d, e, f}
